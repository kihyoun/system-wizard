It does\nnot contain GitLab data, registry image payloads, certificates or renewal state.\nProtect the whole archive as a secret. Recovery metadata is descriptive data only;\nOpen/Push never use it to select images, change storage or start a migration.\n\n1. Read recovery.json (also embedded as recovery in bootstrapper.json). Saved image\n   references are settings; observedRuntime records a separately timestamped\n   authenticated observation when available. Unknown/offline information is not\n   verified and must not be replaced with latest. A browser export can differ from\n   the running platform; reconcile the two before selecting recovery inputs.\n   importedBackup, when present, retains historical unverified evidence from an\n   opened JSON backup. It is not a fresh observation or authority over settings.\n2. Select the completed Harvest Seed corresponding to this configuration and\n   verify its manifest, generation, timestamp and exact GitLab image/version.\n   No matching Seed has been inferred or verified by this configuration export.\n   A newer export and an older Seed are not automatically a matching pair.\n3. Fetch the recorded System source revision with its exact Wizard gitlink:\n   git clone https://github.com/kihyoun/system.git\n   cd system\n   git checkout --detach <recorded-System-source-revision>\n   git submodule update --init --recursive\n   If source identity is unavailable, obtain and verify it before recovery.\n   Public accepted releases include versioned metadata at\n   https://github.com/kihyoun/system/releases with paired immutable images.\n4. Pull the required exact image digests or load separately retained verified\n   Docker image archives. A reference does not preserve an image payload. Keep\n   private/unavailable images recoverable independently, or in the matching\n   restored registry; never substitute a new build for a missing immutable image.\n5. Use recovery tools from accepted System product release 1.0.0 or newer that\n   explicitly support system-configuration-recovery-v1 and the selected Seed. Older\n   controller helpers can reject the extra ZIP entries. A saved old controller\n   image is a runtime selection, not proof of compatible recovery tools. Obtain\n   the compatible accepted tool checkout/controller separately; do not change\n   saved runtime image settings or claim an old runtime version was verified.\n   Follow docs/RECOVERY_CONTRACT.md in the compatible tool checkout: prepare the supported Ubuntu\n   host with bootstrapper/install.sh, select fresh live storage and mount the\n   retained backup filesystem, prepare it with bootstrapper/persistence.sh, then\n   run bootstrapper/seed-operation.sh restore --image <accepted-controller-image>\n   --configuration-backup <absolute-path-to-this-ZIP> --check-only, and repeat\n   without --check-only after reviewing validation. Do not start writers first.\n   Keep host storage selectors separate from imported configuration. Restore\n   requires the Seed's exact GitLab image and refuses existing live service data.\n6. Install the documented certificate integration if applicable, start through\n   start.sh, and verify authenticated Fetch, Wizard, GitLab, registry and runner CI.\n   Use the recorded versions and native upgrade/rollback tools for any later\n   migration; configuration import is not a database upgrade.\n\nFull procedure: https://github.com/kihyoun/system/blob/master/docs/RECOVERY_CONTRACT.md\nThe matching source checkout is the authoritative version of that procedure.\n`;
